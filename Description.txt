Project Title: Inflation Impact Analysis on Exchange Rates  

This project explores the relationship between inflation rates in India and the United States and the USD/INR exchange rate from 1980 to 2024. Using Python for data analysis, it visualizes trends, examines correlations, and tests Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) theory. Key insights include understanding how inflation influences currency value and the real-world applicability of economic models. Tools like pandas, NumPy, and Plotly are leveraged for data-driven insights.
